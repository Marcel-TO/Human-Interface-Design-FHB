## Active Together

In terms of the HID course, we are working on a project called "Active Together". The goal is to fulfill the following:

- What possibilities does the library offer for our form? Try to replace our form fields with components from the library and incorporate form validation (max, min, required) using the library. Can we set custom error messages? The following fields should be present in the form:
    - Name of the registered person
    - Date of birth of the registered person
    - Email checkbox for newsletter subscription for new course offers
    - Dropdown for course selection
- Both tables should be converted into a grid. The Bootstrap Grid technology should be used for this.
    - When I view the website in desktop mode, I want the grid to occupy only 10 columns in width. On mobile, the grid should use the full width of 12 columns.
    - In desktop mode, my columns within my rows should be aligned, i.e., my 10-column wide content should be horizontally centered within the 12 columns. Additionally, I want each row (only in desktop mode!!!!!!) to have a height of x px and the content to be vertically centered within it.
- Mandatory:
    - Inputs, buttons, dropdown
    - Error messages for inputs
    - Style the form with Angular Library
    - Notification popup upon successful course registration (Bootstrap)
    - Menu using Angular Material
    - Convert both tables into a grid with the corresponding requirements
